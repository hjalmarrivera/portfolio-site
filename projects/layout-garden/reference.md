Also - the animation is not that advanced. :wink:
You can do it.

Imagine one state that is “open” and one state that is “closed” - and only at the smaller screen-size, right?

Then use the checkbox hack. You can even hide the input. And you can style the label however you want. (just now I’m wondering what happens if you have many labels!)

and then you can set transition in the css and it’ll just animate.

For offscreen stuff - you’ll want to check out transform: translate()

You can play with this too :wink:
