# Hjalmar's Learning Journal
Hello world! This is a small side-project where I keep notes on what I’m learning at the moment.
You can find me here: https://hjalmar.dev

## 11/21/22
I'm back from a much-needed break, with a new plan to catch up and stay learning every day.

## 11/11/22
I've been mulling this over:

- Maybe only focus on one metric: amount of *cummulative* hours worked without distraction
- Use a work-and-recover approach, focusing for 1 hour, then resting for 1
	- Long-term goal is to help the body adjust to effort even if it's not feeling its best
- Share the metric every day to stay mindful and accountable
- Have a clear "shutdown" period after which you will do no work. Basically find a way to tell your brain "OK, time to rest fully."

## 11/10/22
Today, I am going to catch up on three days' worth of work! Ambitious but let's find out what I can do.

For Tuesday:
- [WIP] Build the Starbucks header, and the section below

For Wednesday:
- [ ] Write a case study for the theme challenge

For Thursday:
- [ ] Improve the mobile version of the theme challenge (specifically: fix the masthead and header section)


## 11/8/22
A new day in the projects workweek! I'll take a look at my docs and choose what to build but right now I'm leaning towards setting up and adding to the layout garden. Posting a list with deliverables in today's channel soon.

- Designing the layout garden real quick (broken up by lines, headings, or one after the other without context? Left aligned or centered? Decisions like that)
- Build the HTML/CSS structure
- Add two modules to it
- Included the layout garden in my site's projects page

## 11/7/22
Today, I...
- Met with Ivy and got organized for a productive week!
- Removed a clunky CRUD form and left my /projects page with simple PHP
- Updated the contents of the /projects list (title, description, and link)
- Fixed a visual bug with the list decoration
- Improved the style of my case study template (I'd like to import my case study over from Substack by the end of the week)
	- Also removed a line of code that was echoing some backend data and added a nav
- I was troubleshooting a visual issue with the site's background SVG but it resolved itself!
- Pushed the changes up to GitHub for that green checkmark :green_heart:


## 10/31/22
Today, I worked through the lesson on WordPress.

## 10/30/22
Today, I'll work through the resources on JSON and style my project so it's ready to go live.

## 10/29/22
OK, so lots of great backend work done today!

Yesterday, I mainly worked on creating a dynamic detail page and making sure the routing worked connected to it + the data being referenced.

Today, I added validation to my project form, and built a basic data structure in a bit of a preview on CRUD apps. I also watched the video on using route-based classes with CSS--which I'll work as soon as I'm done with JSON in a bit.

## Notes
- Do dynamic detail templates negatively affect SEO? How do search engines access the dynamic data?


## 10/28/22
Today, I'm planning and implementing the details page for my framework architecture project with PHP.

## Notes
The deatils page could be linked to through the projects page. 

I want the details page to be a list that loads data on all my projects.

The basic content is:
1. Title
2. Description
3. Link
4. Date?
5. In the future: content to fill out the case study


## 10/27/22
For the project: how are the pages going to look like style and structure-wise across different purposes?

There's the business-card like home. A projects page with links to three selected works. Plus a goals page.

Eventually other pages will be there but this is a start.

I'm thinking about this from a visual perspective for the purposes of partialing out the HTML using PHP. For example, not all of my websites should say "Hello! I'm Hjalmar" on the top--that's already been established in the home page. So, what happens next?

Internal pages: WIP home, projects, resume, goals, blog/list of posts.
External links: GitHub, LinkedIn, e-mail, and Substack


## Notes
- Controler, template
- List, archive, home, detail pages

## Questions
- How do I limit unwated queries?

## 10/26/22

## Notes
For my PHP framework architecture project, I'd like to work on my personal website. I haven't added PHP to it yet and I want to neatly integreate different pages like /goals, /resume, and /projects (with /e4p and /layout-garden).

Creating one template that is populated with dynamic data on the fly. The important part is that we have a list wih a router behind it--so my home page with contextual links in this case?

The detail page that loads dynamically could be a list of my projects.


## 10/19/22
Brand new day and I feel better than yesterday! Yesterday I made progress on my theme-challenge and Derek and I found some spacing and breakpoint issues that are keeping the website from being ship shape--so I'm going to work on that today after the server-side forms lesson.

I also went through the first two chapters of the Exercises for Programmers book (which is a great resource). I also went through all the exercises in chapter two with pseudocode, which was a great experience. It makes the process of coneptualizing and planning a problem/thing to build much more approachable. It's not rocket science. Just practice.

I'm excited to jump into forms today. I have a lot of project ideas for people in Puerto Rico that could use form inputs down the line. I'm not sure if I'll have time for TAD (which originally was for the layout-garden, and then for progress on my personal projects) but I'll try and get to it after the lesson and theme-challenge work.

There's this really great website with lots of challenges called [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) that I would love to tackle for my thing-a-day challenge. It would help me build like a super powered layout garden--but I can't do an entire one each day right now.

Anyway, on with the standup!

## Standup

**Yesterday:**
- I made progress on the theme challenge
- Read the first two chapters of EfP--love this book!
- Went through the exercises from chapter two with pseudocode

**Today:**
- Fix the spacing and breakpoint issues on the theme challenge that Derek and Tara spotted
- I'm really excited to get into forms! A lot of my project ideas down the line involve forms, so it'll be interesting to explore a bit of interaction

## Notes
- Based on Tara and Derek's feedback:
	- Remember that mobile always comes first--it can't be an afterthought when implementing solutions/hacky visual CSS
	- Pay careful attention to spacing decisions early on (or better yet: decide them in the mockup or Affinity Designer stage) because it can come back to bite you by creating lots of inconsistency
- 

## 10/18/22
I haven't been consistent with my notes, mainly because I didn't include them in my "habit stacking" approach. The last week went by like a blur! I'm finishing the theme challenge today (which I've said many times, but I'm actually happy with where it is now--I just have to ask Derek for help on one of the modules and I'm done!).

Then, I'll be jumping into the Exercises for Programmers book. This is very exciting because all this "backend" stuff seems mysterious, and working with a language in a more programmy way--rather than focusing on rendering the webpage visually--seems really different.

I'd like to practice PHP on the side too, because I didn't get to implement it on my website. Starting there could be a good idea since I need to make it modular so that I can maintain a core structure and style across other pages (like my /goals, /resume, /projects pages and more).

Strange how, despite health challenges, I really want to keep learning. Makes me feel like I found my place.

## Standup
Yesterday, I made a lot of progress on my theme-challenge. So much so that it only needs one bug fix and it's done. I got the layout for the article section just how I wanted!

I'll sneak in 20min. to ask Derek for help with a masthead bug. Then, I'll move on the the Exercises for Programmers book and get to chapter 2.

If I have time left, I'll start implementing PHP on my site for practice so it stays fresh on memory.

## Notes
- Writing a problem statement and asking questions (gathering requirements) should be done before jumping into code
- Writing "pseudocode" or directions and steps in plain English is helpful to get an idea of the logic, or steps required to solve the problem
- Test Driven Development boils down to figuring out the inputs, expected output, and actual output
- Algorithms at their most basic are really just step-by-step directions
- Images can go a long way in giving webpages with big "splash" or "hero" images a wow-factor


## 10/12/22
Today's pretty exciting! I'm adding lots of suggestions to the theme challenge site to polish it, and get that "pro" look that comes from the small details that show thoughtfulness.

## Standup
- Implement all of Derek’s great feedback on the theme-challenge (the last 20%)
- Start implementing the suggestions for my website

## Notes


## 10/11/22
Today, I'll work on the second try of my theme challenge. We're fixing bugs and polishing the website's look.

## Standup
- [x] Meet Derek for feedback on the theme website
- [ ] Implement the suggestions / fix bugs--and improve its overall look
- [x] Update the code for my business-card site
- [ ] Responsive. Layout. Garden.

## Notes
- When thinking about what makes a website look polished, the spacing, hover animations, font sizes--all matter. It's in the details. The last 10% - 20%
- I realized this notes file can turn into a great write-up on the bootcamp experience and the learning journey from a career-changer's perspective.

## 10/10/22

## Notes
- Not making a layout / wireframe before going into the CSS feels like skipping a step, but in reality we won't always have access to the code at the styling phase so we don't know how the CSS is going to look like exactly

## Questions
- [ ] How do you make an image background span across two divs?
- [ ] Somestimes I elements with both display:block and display:inline, is that OK? I imagine it has to do with them being custom.
- [ ] How can I make the diptych h1 longer without changing its font size? 
- [ ] Best way to maintain zig-zag grid layout across screen sizes, in regards to spacing issues?
- [ ] What does font-size: clamp do?
- [ ] DO I need to specify different font sizes for alls creen sizes with @media? What are the best practices? Like, where should I put the code? In typography.css or module-specific even if it's typography
- [ ] In regards to the parser's flow, what comes first? SOmetimes, a lower rule would override my changes and it made editing the CSS more confusing.
- [ ] How can I change two sections with the same class separately? Like with the two call-to-action modules
- [ ] How can I make images specifically, in a grid, look longer / taller?


## 10/9/22

## Notes
- Looking at Derek’s code:
 - I never would’ve thought to implement PHP at this level of granularity / specifics--it’s great!
 - At first it took me a bit to wrap my head around it, but it makes much more sense to be this specific. Thinking about future websites, it’s so efficient to mix and match or swap the code in and out as needed
 - A question came up about where to put universal style changes like a background gradient that spans the whole page? I imagine in the highest-level css file, which is style.css
 - Comparing my code to Derek’s, my initial impression is that my HTML was OK (good naming convention and nesting). My CSS is messier but works
 - Read loading='lazy' on an image? That seems interesting, going to look it up
 - Using the database array for the article-grid seems so clever but it’s literally what we learned in the lessons! So I want to try implementing it from scratch on a personal project because it still feels “like magic”

## 10/7/22
Today, I will finish the style tile from yesterday (I did a lot of research and testing visuals in Affinity Designer) and translate it to CSS.

## 10/6/22

## Standup
- [x] Research an industry/niche for my theme challenge
- [ ] Create a style tile based on my research
- [ ] I want to work efficiently so I can have time to add a new module to my layout garden, or update my website
- [x] Meet with Derek
- [ ] Implement Derek’s feedback on the theme challenge code
	- [ ] Also, add PHP for practice
	- [x] Fix the large anchor link

"Today’s goal is to get a sense of how this industry tells its story through a website. There is no copy to write for this final project (use what is provided in the template) – so keep in mind there will be no clues as to what the business site is or who you created it for.

Your font choice will matter very much – as well as any graphics you may create or colors that you utilize, images, etc… as these are the components that we will be using to help with the storytelling.

Consider these visual components as you are researching around and write down what you see in terms of…

What is working
What isn’t
What keywords or phrases keep coming up,
What is hitting you on the head?
Write it all down as it will be a large part of your case study. Takes lots of screenshots.

This is a new client and they want to know that you understand their industry and how you came to your conclusions.

Use any tools you have to organize your thoughts and get as much as you can in the time frame. Maybe 3 sittings of 1 hour each?"

## Questions
- [x] How much should be PHP? Article cards for sure. But should all modules be PHP? Header and footer too?
- [x] How to approach making code cleaner and less redundant? I imagine: thinking about someone else reading it, adding comments, asking if the code there is necessary, asking yourself/someone else if there's a better way to implement the code, etc.

## 10/5/22
I'm continuing with the super responsive layout challenge. I'll write the code, get it reviewed, implement any feedback, then research how it will look theme-wise.

## Standup
- [x] Code up the layout
- [x] Share my progress so far

## Notes
- For a beginner portfolio, I think this might work (they show design, HTML, CSS, and PHP):

## Quesitons
- [x] In the context of Frontend Development, what do we mean by *theme* and *template*?
- [ ] I forgot: what's the difference between margin and padding in CSS?
- [ ] For a beginner-level website that is complete, what can I feature there? I think the following projects might help. Anything else?
		- A simple business card website
		- An updated version of the Joyfully Clean website or monsters site?
		- The best 2 - 3 graphics I've made
		- The responsive layout garden with 5+ examples
		- The theme challenge

## 10/4/22
I'm starting a "theming" challenge where I code a responsive layout and then work on the CSS to make it look pro!

### Standup
- [ ] Code the responsive layout for the theme challenge ASAP
- [ ] If there's time, meet with Derek for code review and questions / show the code so far

### Notes
- Today I got side-tracked doing errands and with life stuff coming up. When that happens often, it's something about my approach. So, I'm thinking that I should work on the lessons first thing every morning so if anything comes up that might disrupt my workday it's OK--I already did the most important things.

## 10/3/22
I continued working on my website, goals page, and other side-project type work like writing a case study for my first small business website.

### Standup
- Weekend:
	- I had a PHP party!
	- Created the monster adoption site! Lots of fun
	-	Other topics that come to mind: delimiter, statement, operator, argument, function (might be time for a /study-hall review)
	- Learned more about HSL (I much prefer HSL to using RGB)

- Today:
	- [x] Implement Derek’s feedback on my monsters site
	- [x] Organize folder structure locally and on Transmit
	- [x] If there’s time, keep troubleshooting why DeployBot isn’t working for me even though it’s error-free
	- [x] Finish coding up the HTML and CSS for my goals page at hjalmar/goals/index.html
		- Why I’ve taken so long: I didn’t plan my website’s design in a flexible enough way, and a simple goals list looks terrible because of my CSS, so I’m making a separate style file
		- I also kept changing my mind about goals for a long time and they feel very solid now
	- [x] Draft a case study for my Joyfully Clean project
	- [x] Schedule a meeting with Derek IF he’s available today!

### Notes
- Custome elements are display: inline by default, so set them to block!
- PHP doesn't come default on all computers. In order to use a package in Sublime, we had to install it. Also, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for macOS is great.
- Seems simple but it's really all there is: "It’s just sitting down - and doing the work - and staying clear on your intention." - Derek
- Fun fact--markdown can accept HTML!
- When note taking, explaining concepts in my own words helps check for understanding.
- In regards to my personal website:
	- There's an accidental rag in the projects/articles section
	- Don't just center things without purpose!
	- I can use PHP for the list of articles and projects. Remake it with PHP!
	- Try experimenting with grid or other layouts in the future--but for now, get the basics down in a business card format. Simple, effective layout.
	- Watch out for unintentional shapes (like a cross) being created accidentally
	- In the future I can add a suprise button that makes the website more colorful when clicked, so it can be professional at first glance but with room to be fun

### Questions
So far, I have a few questions:

- General:
	- [x] "If you put the radius and overflow on the parent (picture element) - then it will act like a mask" - Derek
	- I have lots of project ideas and picked these three. Which one would whelp me learn the most and look good on a portfolio?
		- A business card website generator (for when SquareSpace is too much and Linktree is too little) using PHP and taking user data from a Google form
		- A portfolio site for my partner who's a photographer and architect, so a very image-heavy design and build
		- A PSA-style website similar to nohello.net talking about how "lootboxes" (video game gambling) is dangerous
	- Instead of doing icons or other graphics in Affinity Designer for the thing-a-day challenge, could I make a style tile or module for the responsive layout garden every day? I feel like those two would help me move forward on my portfolio projects. Or is it also important to keep making graphics for TAD?
	- Question about custom elements in HTML and their interactions in CSS 


- Troubleshooting:
	- [x] Sublime's Package Manager doesn't let me install the PHP Syntax Checker. What do?
		- I didn't hit "enter"
	- [x] DeployBot doesn't show any errors but it's not updating my files after pushing them through GitHub.

- Personal website-related:
	- [x] What's the right way to include fonts into websites?
	- [x] I'm trying to make a card that is half image and half text, but can't. How do I get an image to be only half of its parent in the context of flexbox? Using width: 50% isn't working.
	- Regarding website titles (metadata information) is it best to repeat your information--like "Hjalmar's Site" or change it based on the specific page--like "Hjalmar's Goals"

- Job-related:
	- What distinguishes a web developer that earns $200K from one earning $50K?
	-	What can I start doing early to set myself up for success later one?
	- What is realistic to aim for with the first job search?
	- When writing blog posts or articles for other websites, how do you know what topics would make you more hirable? For example, I don't think it's very useful to repost my small business case study to DEV. What should I post on my blog only and what should I repost or aim to publish elswhere?

## 10/2/22
Today was a catchup day for lessons and related work.

### Standup
- Sundays are standup-free!

### Notes
- Where can you use PHP?
	- PHP seems useful whenever you're working with dynamic (changing data) or lots of data. In the context of web development, it doesn't seem intuitive to copy-paste a module hundreds of times when you can just write the code once and call it as needed by looping through an array.
	- As for dynamic data, using an array beats going into the code itself and writing each new item. I imagine we'll eventually learn how to point PHP to external files so it can process the data and add it to our code.
	- I also see PHP being used in websites that are mostly changing, or that change based on context. Social media immediately comes to mind because no one is seeing exactly the same site beyond a core strucutre. So the content itself is modular, and it's more about having PHP files that can swap out as needed (... and probably based on instructions from the brainwashy algorithms).
- I think PHP would be great to use in a project that Derek and I talked about for small businesses in Puerto Rico who don't have websites. It's basically a business card site generator. Using PHP, we could somhow take simple instructions from say a Google form and have it automatically converted to a site.
- Examples in the wild:
	- Definetely Facebook 100%, I imagine Instagram too. I've heard that WordPress uses PHP a lot.

## 10/1/22
This week's lessons are on PHP. I was super sick and got behind but I'm all caught up now!

### Standup
I missed standup after an improptu doctor's appointment.

### Notes:
- I imagine if/elseif statements in PHP can be used alongside HTML/CSS somehow to pick and choose which files to load depending.
- PS: I regret not taking more notes during this process because PHP is super interesting, and I wanted to review its key concepts.
- A few keywords that come to mind: control flow/logic, conditionals, loops, statements, arguments, arrays, associative arrays (or objects), concatenation, delimiters, functions

## 09/22/22

### Standup

Today,
- Met with Derek to talk about the responsive layout garden and it’s overarching goals
- Created two sets of icons
- Edited my offline /goals file  so I can code it up into HTML/CSS tomorrow
	-  I also gathered everything into one document (project ideas, style tiles, mood board, website copy, etc.) so I have a clear idea of what I want for my website
- Creating another icon for my TAD challenge--this time thinking about traffic signs
- Adding my notes to GitHub
- Sharing some visual inspiration I found while snooping around the alphanet (that some people in alpha-4 might recognize!) :eyes:


### Notes:
- Icons are a universe:
	- They can lose their effect if made too big
	- They need to be distinguishable when small
	- It's important that they are cohesive--you can get this effect by reusing elements like stroke, shapes, and colors
	- There are standard sizes like 36 x 36
- Regarding building responsive layouts:
	- Copy another website to reverse-engineer their approach. Did they use flexbox, grid, a framework?
	- Create and delete; quantity is better than quality in this case, where you can become vert proficient and whipping up modules or full responsive layouts really quickly
- I've come to realize that I love pastel colors
- A lot of the internet looks the same with a header, main content that's mostly long rectanlges within a constrained inner column-type space, and then a footer.
	- An approach to making things refreshing is building websites as if they were posters. Why? There's a huge and rich tradition in typography, graphic design, and art that we can pull from as designers and developers.
		- From structure to contrast and negative space, this poster approach can really differentiate a site.

## 09/21/22
I'm back after a surviving my second hurricane! I caught up fast after doing four or so lessons in one day, pretty surprised.

### Standup

Today,
- √ Finished each day’s TAD icon
- √ Re-created an e-commerce store site
- √ Created a quick style tile for my personal site
- √ Made a simple postcard in AD
- √ Created a black and white graphic representing a word that had to be guessed
- Finally, created another style tile that is e-commerce focused (for an audiphile store)


### Notes:
- When designing for yourself, it helps to image that you are the client. The distance makes it easier to think about your goals and ways to present them visually before building a prototype.
- We all absorb visual information in different ways. Sometimes and abstract or practical poster says a completely different message than we intended. So it's important to ask people what colors, words, textures, layouts, and design in general feels like. Ask them to describe it as best they can.
- What an interesting exercise… I ended up with two styles that are completely different than what I aimed for.
- I love simplicity. I start with crazy visuals in my head but always end up doing something minimal.
- Lots of colors have their place, but black and white goes a long way. It's important to makes sure that "visual tricks" are not there just to paint over a boring canvas.
- I like focusing on text rather than images--so that’s why I enjoy using little tricks like text gradients to type pop

## 09/15/22
In today's lesson we took a deep dive into typography and specifically into rules for contrast and space.

### Standup

Yesterday,
- Took some notes during the lesson videos
- Thought about what the exercises could be like
- Played around with space in my mood board
- Digitized one of the layouts I sketched with - Affinity Designer to explore white space and alignment
- Upload the journal notes and share my ideas about the process
- Do a quick thing-a-day
Share visual inspo.

Today,
- The dailies:
	- Shared visual inspo.
	- Writing notes on Milka and Chris’ critiques
	- Drawing a new icon
	- Practicing the Drawabox lesson
	- Setting up DeployBot :robot_face:
	- Digitize another one of my layouts to AD so I can compare ideas for the personal website
	- Check-in on StackOverflow to see if there are any questions to ask / answer
	- Work on a blog post draft in my Substack


### Notes:
Chris Do's rules
1. Flush left (more natural)
2. Use one type face--it's hard to know if you're using two successfully
3. Skip a font weight for contrast
4. Double point size, and sometimes triple or quadruple for dramatic effect
5. Align everything to one axis
6. Use any typeface you like as long is it's one he recommends, haha (my favorite is in there--Baskerville!)
7. Group objects by using rules or lines
8. Avoid the corners--negative space is good, so don't put things on the edge or corner unless it's to cut the object off
9. Careful with the spacing at the end and beginning of words, sentences, and paragraphs. Avoid creating accidental shapes (rag).

- Limiting parameters is great because you consider other elements like negative space
- Hierarchy means what do you read first, second, third
	- Mass (large, medium small)
	- Bold, regular, light
	- Many, few 
	- Tall, short
- Avoid using many tricks. The eyes get lost.
- Avoid slanted or "off-grid" layouts with text, so diagonal
- Space can be measure: small, medium, large
- Watch out for leding, when letters touch each other
- Sometimes having things be the same is boring
- Dead space is space that doesn't have a reason, no breathing, contrast, etc. 
- Do not stretch the type!
- What if? What if? Ask it all the time when creating.
- Rythm comes with interaction between objects
- Confusion can come up when there's no main focal point or a reason behind decisions. Putting a couple of "cool things" together doesn't always work.
- When you rotate the axist of text (like making text that would normally be horizontal into a vertical line) you can accidentally create visual barriers
- Do many many versions
- Chris Do also says that with logo design there's too many tricks! Why is that bad? Too many tricks MAKE THINGS AGE BAD. You age well with simplicity.

## 09/14/22
Today's lesson was on negative space and how that looks like in web layouts or mood boards (those were the main examples but the concepts are very universal).

- Have a design system--once you establish why you like what you like, it'll need to be reproduced in the future. "I like it just because," isn't modular / scalable
- Negative space is in-between, around, inside, etc. What isn't occupied at the moment depending on how you look at it.
- Playing with contrast or juxtaposing different objects together can really change the look and feel of what you see. Colors, shapes, sizes, proximity, etc.
- Ask "what if" often when exploring how a layout or design looks. There's an early testing phase where you're trying to find what "feels right" and then decide why. Asking "what if I do this?" and then doing it speeds up the discovery process.
- Also, understanding why you're arranging objects that way / making that design choice will come in handy when selling your idea to the client or team.
- Weight (border thickness, object size) can really draw the eye, can be used strategically

### Questions
- What sizes should I use in Affinity Designer to mimic mobile, tablet, and screen displays? I waant to be precise.
- Unrelated but for my icon challenge, I should find out sizes icons are normally at
- My skills don't match my vision yet. I want to be able to template / layout build faster and more accurately with Affinity Designer. Then actually code it!
